# Introduction
I joined CSIRO in 2009 and worked in the Contract Administration Office until 2014. Since then, I've covered a variety of roles supporting Project Support, In-Business Finance, Research Office and currently the Project Support Centre (Corporate Finance.) Prior to commencing Data School I could code in HTML and a bit of C, but its applications were largely restricted to extra-curricular activities away from CSIRO. Learning R and aspect of Data Management appealed to me as an attractive and valuable skill that could be applied in practice for the purposes of reporting, file management systems and general compliance requirements.

# My Project

This project could be best regarded as an attempt to replicate a process that is currently handled manually which consists of two primary components: 1) data import, wrangling and tidying; 2) visualisation and communication. This process is part of preparing the Project Support Centre (PSC) monthly report, which informs part of the wider Finance Support Centre reporting.

One of the identified issues with preparation of the PSC report is that it is currently a manual process and is time-consuming and potentially prone to data duplication and human errors. 



In order to build this demo poster correctly, you will also need to have installed the `tidyverse`, 
`gapminder`, and `kableExtra` packages.

** !! Include an image of what the report looked like on the original spreadsheet, maybe include a screengrab of what the raw data looked like too. **

** A snippet of the Miro process mapping might be good.**

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate the different visuals you might want use to show off your 
project. Don't feel the need to go overboard, this is supposed to give a taste of the work you are
doing rather than being a publication ready document.

To get tables formatting correctly, use `knitr::kable` to convert the table to html format. If
you also want to have alternate row highlighting, pass the result to `kable_styling('striped')` 
from the `kableExtra` package.



** This is a test version of a table generated from data **

# Read in final report summary. This has been duplicated from the data/outputs directory in the R project and put into the Markdown directory: resources/final.csv.

knitr::kable(head(PSC_open_long, n = 7), format = "html", caption = "Open PSC tasks: 2019-20 FY") %>%

**Acutal text to follow: below is a chart detailing Open PSC tasks for FY 2019-20. text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text**

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='left', fig.height= 4, fig.width=8, fig.cap="Open PSC tasks: 2019-20 FY"}

PSC_open <- PSC_open_gathered %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = n, fill = Task)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") +
  labs(
    title = "Open PSC tasks: 2019-20 FY (up to Apr-20)",
    x = "Month",
    y = "Count",
    colour = "Task"
  ) + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  ) 

PSC_open <- PSC_open +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, size = 10, vjust = 0.5))

PSC_open


```

Here's an animation of the above chart. I think the animated aspect lends greater insight into the work volume over the course of the year and indicates particular trends.

This animation incorporates transition_time() and shadow_mark() functions, whilst an ease_aes() function smooths the transitions. The timing of the animation is controlled further by rendering the animation using the animate() function.

Whilst this animation details both Open and Completed PSC Tasks from month-to-month over the 2019-20 FY. I'm not entirely sure how informative it is at this stage. However, it could definitely be improved by fixing the date stamp and replacing this with the name of the month instead.
