# Introduction
I joined CSIRO in 2009 and worked in the Contract Administration Centre until 2014. Since then, I've covered a variety of roles supporting Project Support, In-Business Finance, Research Office and currently the Project Support Centre (Corporate Finance.) Prior to commencing Data School I could code in HTML and a bit of C, but its applications were largely restricted to extra-curricular activities away from CSIRO. Learning R and aspect of Data Management appealed to me as an attractive and valuable skill that could be applied in practice for the purposes of reporting, file management systems and general compliance activities.

# My Project

#### From manual input to R workflow

This project could be best regarded as an attempt to replicate a process that is currently handled manually which consists of two primary components: 1) data import, wrangling and tidying; 2) visualisation and communication. 


#### The PSC Monthly report

This process is part of preparing data the Project Support Centre (PSC) monthly report. The PSC monthly summary reports on the status of tasks recorded across JIRA and O2D, and these inform part of the larger Finance Support Centre reporting at month's end.


#### Issues with the manual process

One of the identified issues with preparation of the PSC report is that it is currently a manual process and is time-consuming and potentially prone to data duplication and human errors. 


#### The R workflow: replicating a manual process in Excel

In order to take this manual process and realise it as an R workflow, I would need to take the manual work currently done in Excel (copy/paste, filtering, pivot tables, cell references, etc) and replicate this as R code, employing a number of functions and successive dataframes to ensure the data was going to the right place.  

#### Wrangling, tidying, transforming

The goal of the main R workflow was to wrangle large chunks of data - extracted from JIRA nad O2D - and transform this into concise summaries of open and completed JIRA and O2D tasks for each month. From here, the summaries are brought together and comprise a complete summary of the Financial Year-To-Date. For the purposes of the PSC report, only the open statuses need to be reported upon.

## Preliminary results

This section will demonstrate visualisations.


#### Visualisation of reporting data

**text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text text**

The table and plot detailed above are the key elements incorporated into the PSC Report. In addition to replicating this .... I thought I would see how some of these visualisations could be represented as animations ....

#### Animation of plots

The following is an animation of the above chart. I think the animated aspect lends greater insight into task volume over the course of the year and is indicative of particular trends, especially prior to and following the EOFY period.

The animation incorporates `transition_time()` and `shadow_mark()` functions, whilst an `ease_aes()` function smooths the transitions. The timing of the animation is controlled further by rendering the animation using the `animate()` function.

Although this next animation is less useful for the purposes of reporting, I thought it would be interesting to examine both open and completed task statuses transitioned over each month, utilising a `facetwrap()` function to position each task status side-by-side for comparison. A potential improvement to the animated plot could be to fix the date stamp and replace this with the name of the month following each transition state.

# My Digital Toolbox (TBC)

What digital tools have you been using in your project? Do you expect that everything will be able 
to be completed within R, or will you need to work with multiple tools to get the right result?
Which of the digital skills needed for your project have you learned since starting Data School?

You can use all the usual R markdown features in writing a project summary, including lists:

* R - dplyr, ggplot, ...
* Python
* SQL
